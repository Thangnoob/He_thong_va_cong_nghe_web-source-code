        A smile is a facial formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth.It is
        believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some slimes include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes,
        an action known as a "Duchense smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
